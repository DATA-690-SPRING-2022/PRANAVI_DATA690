# Education and its impact on other factors like employment and economic growth.

     Education is  the acquisition of knowledged and personal development. Education is  helpful in transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. education provides us lot of information and creates a platform for liberation



Analysis Strategy and Approach

Data Source: World Development Explorer 

Countries Analyzed: 

Timespan of Data: 2010-2018

Topics & Indicators:

The general trends shown in the time series were that for the majority of these countries between 2000 and 2015, CO2 emissions decreased or flatlined, life expectancy increased, communicable disease mortality decreased, and non-communicable disease mortality increased.
Analysis of the three-dimensional scatterplots showed that North Korea, Denmark, and Uruguay had the most positive relationships between decreasing CO2 emissions and life expectancy
The three-dimensional scatterplots also showed that the general disease trends were a decrease in communicable disease mortality and an increase in non-communicable disease mortality with positive changes in life expectancy and negative changes in CO2 emissions between 2000 and 2015
As shown in the bar graphs, the countries chosen each had significant increases in renewable energy usage between 2000 and 2015
The correlation heatmaps showed that there was a moderate to strong negative correlation betwen noncommunicable disease mortality and renewable energy usage, and the opposite was true for communicable disease mortality rates.
Both heatmaps showed insignificant negative correlation between renewable energy usage and life expectancy, which shows that life expectancy is less significantly related to renewable energy usage than non-communicable and communicable disease mortalities.
4. Conclusions
This data on its own does not tell a complete story of how CO2 emissions and renewable energy are a factor in disease mortality and life expectancy. However, there are a few preliminary conclusions that can be made from the analyzed data trends.

The relationship between CO2 emissions, life expectancy, and disease mortality rates over time showed that with a negative trend in CO2 emissions comes an increase in life expectancy and non-communicable disease mortality and a decrease in communicable disease mortality
The relationship between renewable energy usage and disease mortality is more significant than the relationship between renewable energy usage and life expectancy. Communicable disease mortality appeared to have positive correlation with renewable energy usage, and the opposite was true for non-communicable disease mortality.
Interestingly, the results of both comparisons show divergent results. Decreases in CO2 emissions should result in the same trends for disease as an increase in renewable energy usage when it comes to disease and life expectancy, but the disease trends are opposed and the life expectancy trends are insignificant. This shows a necessity to investigate environmental factors and human health in a more detailed fashion, with more indicators present to show a stronger significance in the relationship.
