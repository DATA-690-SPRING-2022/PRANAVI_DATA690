Education is  the acquisition of knowledged and personal development. Education is  helpful in transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. education provides us lot of information and creates a platform for liberation of ideas.In this project we are going to analyze what is the education ratio between two countries i.e India and afganisthan.The motive of this project is to analyze what is the ration and how it impacts other factors such as social development as we go on we get to understand what differenece that it makes without education and also how people are moving towards to gain education from the years 2010-2018. We are going to learn  a analyses throught the graphs why education is important.Here in this i have just considered few indicators there are many other indicators which are clearly showing that how education is considered in both countries and the result of no-education.

  The graph is a bar chart which is helpful in comparing the countries.In this we can observe that afganisthan has low education in the total population when compared to india

  In this graph the female population having no education is more in afganisthan than india

  In this we get to see how female workers are enforced to work as labours has they don't have education and the linear regreesion graph shows the relation
 
  ![](https://github.com/Pranavigadikoppula/PRANAVI_DATA690/blob/main/world_development_explorer/heatmap.png)
  
  This is the heat map which shows the relation between the female of age 15+ working as labours and the unemployment for females to the female of age 15+- having no education .
  here has there is no education available people are not getting any work oppurtunities if they get so they work as labours.
  
  # conclusion:
  
There can be several factors for not having education has there criteria while i was exploring the wdx i have found that some of the reasons are the countries population as there is huge population it is really harder to provide education for every individual . The other reasons are countries economy when afghanisthan economy is compared to india it was less so this might be the reason why afghanisthan is behind india. The other reason is as there are very less educated people in the past years the amount of teachers are very less to teach .One of the reason is afganisthan as other source of income rather than through education it is more dependent on trading.
The observations we get to know through this is if there is no education they are more into working as labour and the female education ratio is very less when compared to total population  as there are less educated womans the employment of womans are very less.
